        <h4>About:</h4>
        <p class="fs-5">Internet of Things (IoT) is a bionetwork of connected physical objects that are reachable through
            the internet. The Internet of Things promises to transform a wide range of fields. IoT has evolved from the
            convergence of wireless technologies, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), micro services and the
            internet. The convergence has helped tear down the silos between operational technology (OT) and information
            technology (IT), enabling unstructured machine- generated data to be analyzed for insights to drive
            improvements.</p>
