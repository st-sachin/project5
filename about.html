    <h1>About Committee Management System: </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 23px;">

   The topic of our project is the ‘College Committee Management System’, which will be helpful for managing all the committees in the college together and efficiently. This College Committee Management System will be managing all the data, the type of events, the upcoming events, and the past events of all the committees. This system will keep a record of the total strength of the committee, the total number of members who are currently present in the particular committee, and will also show the user if any slot/position is vacant in a particular committee and also the pre-requisites to join a particular committee.
Thus this system will be very helpful for the user to get all the information of a particular committee and will also help the user in choosing the right committee according to his/her interests. Also, the committees will find the system useful as it will manage their data in a systematic and efficient format.
